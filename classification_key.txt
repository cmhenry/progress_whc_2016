Classify case by quadratic term significance, quadratic term slope, and linear term slope.
(1) Linear growth - If the p-value for b4 >= 0.05 and the slope b1 > 0.05 per year
(2) Linear decline - If the p-value for b4 >= 0.05 and the slope b1 < -0.05 per year
(0) No change - If the p-value for b4 >= 0.05 the slope b1 is between -0.05 and 0.05 per year
(3) Saturation - if the p-value for b4 < 0.05 and the slope b4 < 0 and the slope b1 > 0 and the maximum value of any data point is >= 95%
(4) Acceleration - if the p-value for b4 < 0.05 and the slope b4 > 0 and the slope b1 > 0
(5) Deceleration - if the p-value for b4 < 0.05 and the slope b4 < 0 and the slope b1 > 0 and the maximum value of all data points is < 95%
(6) Negative acceleration - if the p-value for b4 < 0.05 and the slope b4 < 0 and the slope b1 < 0
(7) Negative deceleration - if the p-value for b4 < 0.05 and the slope b4 > 0 and the slope b1 < 0
